- Overview

This project explores a regression problem using a structured dataset (Kaggle Playground Series).
The goal was to predict Flood Probability based on numerical features.

🛠️ Steps Performed

- Data Exploration & Visualization

- Analyzed numerical feature distributions with colorful histograms.

- Examined correlations between variables to identify redundancies.

Modeling

- Implemented multiple regression models:

  - Linear Regression

  - Ridge & Lasso Regression

- Compared models using R² Score as the evaluation metric.

Best Result

- Achieved an R² Score of 0.844 using Linear Regression with preprocessing.

📊 Key Learnings

- Feature distributions across numerical columns can often look similar due to scaling or synthetic datasets.

- Linear models (Ridge, Lasso) provided better interpretability through coefficients, while non-linear models (KNN, SVM) were more computationally expensive.
